	<p>Exhibiting and/or selling art is only allowed for artists (or their respective agents) with a valid (accepted) registration in the the Art Show. Either the artist itself and/or their respective agent must also be a registered attendee of Eurofurence. We do not offer remote services to artist or agents not attending Eurofurence.</p>
	
	<p>A registration request can be submitted following a successful registration as an attendee of Eurofurence. A registration to the Art Show can be obtained through a separate registration form. Panel and table space is available in different quantities; see the list of available ressources below. All applications will be collected until the end of the registration phase. The Art Show Management will review all applications. Mind that the Art Show Management curates the setup to offer a great experience to all attendees and best possible sales for the artists. Thus, the management decides on the panel assignment and placement. Based on the decisions made, registrations will be accepted as is, reduced in display space quantity, or declined. This process may take up to six weeks after the end of the registration phase.</p>
	
	<p>Registrations that were initially not accepted are put on hold and will be re-evaluated once space becomes available due to cancellations. Mind that, once accepted, booked panel- or table space and its fee is non-refundable. However, if requested, the transfer of your booked package can be arranged but must be approved by the Art Show managment. The curation process still applies here. Please get in touch with us to discuss possible options to transfer your package.</p>
	
	<p>The Art Show separates between general and adult artwork. Blood, violence and sexual content count as adult. Please consult our elaborate guide for further details. We understand that the lines sometimes blur. When in doubt, contact us beforehand. We glady offer advice and help. Furthermore, the display of copyrighted characters is prohibited. In addition, all art must comply with the national laws. The Art Show team reserves the right to deny the display of pieces.</p>
	
	<p>Setup slots are offered on Wednesday and (if needed) Thursday. In general, a setup of the panel is also possible during all opening times. However, the Art Show is hosting several events and may decline the setup during those times to not interfere with the events taking place. Teardown and pickup of unsold art happens on Saturday. The Art Show does not store any uncollected exhibits. We advice to study the frequently published Art Show schedule and make plans according to it. We advice to obtain you convention badge before entering the Art Show for setup. In case you were not able to pick up your badge, talk to us at the Art Show service desk.</p>
	
	<p>Mind that the Art Show does not offer any kind of locker or storage service. In no account the Art Show can be held liable for damage or losses of any kind. Please make sure to arrange your setup and teardown in a way it complies with our process. Ask friends to help you when in need for help. We allow assisting hands.</p>
	
	<p>In case of question, please read the full guide on the Art Show. Mind that the Art Show Management has the right to interpret any rules as they see fit. Decisions made be the Art Show Management are final. We do want to offer a great experience to anyone. Attendees and artists alike. So let's work hand in hand and be mindful of each other.</p>

	<div>
		<h3 class="reset-font">Step I: Application</h3>
		<p>The application period for Art Show will open on <strong>15th February 2025</strong> and will be accessible up to and <strong>including 30th March 2025</strong>.</p>
		<p>To be eligible for registration as artist or agent, a prior registration for Eurofurence 2025 (the event) via the Eurofurence <a href="https://identity.eurofurence.org" title="Eurofurence Identitiy" target="_blank">Registration System</a> is mandatory. After registering for the event a Art Show application can be <a href="https://help.eurofurence.org/contact/artshow/application" title="Register for the Art Show" target="_blank">submitted here</a>. During Art Show registration, the desired panel and table configuration can be applied for.</p>
		<p>Art Show applications without valid previous event registration will be canceled.</p>
		<p>The Art Show Management will review submissions after the registration period has ended. Status emails about approval, denial, or being put on the waiting list will be sent after the review. Upon approval, the artists'/agents' Eurofurence registration will be updated with a granted package. The package will show up as an extra amount due in the Eurofurence registration once approved and booked. Payment is handled through the Eurofurence registration website. </p>
		<p>Please note that any and all additional obligations like trade fair and exhibition visa, sales tax or income tax declarations have to be fulfilled by the artist. Eurofurence expects all artists to be fully aware of their responsibilities in accordance with applicable law in Germany as well as their country of origin and will neither assist nor advise on these matters. Please set up an appointment with your nearest German embassy or consulate regarding questions about the application process for a trade fair and exhibition visa / Schengen visa.</p>
		<p>The date of registration neither influences the amount of panel or table space nor the chance of any space being allocated to an artist at all.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h3 class="reset-font">Step II: Approval</h3>
		<p>Partaking in the Art Show will be approved on a curated basis.</p>
		<p>Curation will be performed by the Art Show management. Panels and tables be assigned based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:
			<ul>
				<li>Quality, style, media, techniques, space available, past experiences with the artist</li>
				<li>Prominence: the Eurofurence Art Show aims to promote newcommers as well as showcase well known artists.</li>
				<li>New Concepts and showcases: the Eurofurence Art Show is not only a place to sell art, but also to showcase craftsmanship.</li>
				<li>Performance: Art is not only a still object observe but also experience. The Eurofurence Art Show also offers a stage for Art performances. Get in touch with us.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h3 class="reset-font">Step III: Payment</h3>
		<p>After approval, the Art Show registration will be updated to include the fee for the assigned ressources. The artist is required to pay the fee at the same time as their respective Eurofurence event registration fee, using their preferred payment method.</p>
		<p>Please pay on time. If payment is overdue, Art Show management may cancel an application and offer the space to the next artist on the waiting list.</p>
		<p>Eurofurence e.V. handles all transactions in Euro (€). Fees must be paid via credit or debit cards. Eurofurence e.V. does not accept PayPal, cash payment or any other method of payment. All payments must be handled through the Eurofurence Registration System. Never send any credit card information via email!</p>
	</div>
	<div>
	<h3 class="reset-font">Step IV: Placement</h3>
		<p>Upon completion of payment, the Art Show management will assign the granted space (panels and tables). The position of the panel assigned is entirely up to the Art Show management. When more than one panel was assigned, all panels will be assigned next to each other. Except for regular and adult themed panels. Those exist of two separate sections. </p>
	</div>
	<div>
	<h3 class="reset-font">Waiting List</h3>
		<p>Any application not initially accepted in Step II will be placed on a waiting list curated under the same factors. Information about this status will also be sent to the respective artist or agent after Step IV is completed. Changes to the original applications via email reply to the waiting list information might lead to a reevaluation of the application on the waiting list.</p>
		<p>If panel or table space becomes available again due to the cancellation of another artist, the next best match based on curation from the waiting list will be contacted. There will be limited time to respond, usually only about a week. Once the artist has confirmed their newly assigned space, the (not yet paid) corresponding package will be added to the artists or agents Eurofurence registration, and the payment will be due immediately.</p>
		<p>There might be last-minute sales of canceled panel or table spaces on a first come, first serve basis at the convention itself, starting 12:00 (noon) on Thursday for unclaimed panels or tables.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h3 class="reset-font">Cancellations</h3>
		<p>If an artist/agent can no longer make use their registration, they are asked to contact Art Show management via email in a timely manner. <span class="uk-text-italic">Not doing so is considered unfair to other artists who are on the waiting list and will lead to a lower priority during curation on future registrations to the Art Show.</span></p>
		<p><strong>Packages are non-refundable and cannot be canceled. However, transfers of packages are possible but can only be initiated and approved by the Art Show management. Artists/agents cannot select or nominate individuals from the waiting list for a transfer to bypass the curation process. </strong> If a transfer is desired, please contact the Art Show management with your suggestion. All transfer requests will be considered by the management team, who will have the final say in the approval of the new artist.</p>
