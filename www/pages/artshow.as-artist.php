	<div>
		<p>Exhibiting and/or selling art is only allowed for artists (or their respective agents) with a valid (accepted) registration in the the Art Show. Either the artist itself and/or their respective agent must also be a registered attendee of Eurofurence. We do not offer remote services to artist or agents not attending Eurofurence.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>A registration request can be submitted following a successful registration as an attendee of Eurofurence. A registration to the Art Show can be obtained through a separate registration form. Panel and table space is available in different quantities; see the list of available resources below. All applications will be collected until the end of the registration phase. The Art Show Management will review all applications. Mind that the Art Show Management curates the setup to offer a great experience to all attendees and best possible sales for the artists. Thus, the management decides on the panel assignment and placement. Based on the decisions made, registrations will be accepted as is, reduced in display space quantity, or declined. This process may take up to six weeks after the end of the registration phase.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>Registrations that were initially not accepted are put on hold and will be re-evaluated once space becomes available due to cancellations. Mind that, once accepted, booked panel- or table space and its fee is non-refundable. However, if requested, the transfer of your booked package can be arranged but must be approved by the Art Show management. The curation process still applies here. Please get in touch with us to discuss possible options to transfer your package.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>The Art Show separates between general and adult artwork. Blood, violence and sexual content count as adult. Please consult our elaborate guide for further details. We understand that the lines sometimes blur. When in doubt, contact us beforehand. We glady offer advice and help. Furthermore, the display of copyrighted characters is prohibited. In addition, all art must comply with the national laws. The Art Show team reserves the right to deny the display of pieces.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>Setup slots are offered on Wednesday and (if needed) Thursday. In general, a setup of the panel is also possible during all opening times. However, the Art Show is hosting several events and may decline the setup during those times to not interfere with the events taking place. Teardown and pickup of unsold art happens on Saturday. The Art Show does not store any uncollected exhibits. We advice to study the frequently published Art Show schedule and make plans according to it. We advice to obtain you convention badge before entering the Art Show for setup. In case you were not able to pick up your badge, talk to us at the Art Show service desk.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>Mind that the Art Show does not offer any kind of locker or storage service. In no account the Art Show can be held liable for damage or losses of any kind. Please make sure to arrange your setup and teardown in a way it complies with our process. Ask friends to help you when in need for help. We allow assisting hands.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>In case of question, please read the full guide on the Art Show. Mind that the Art Show Management has the right to interpret any rules as they see fit. Decisions made be the Art Show Management are final. We do want to offer a great experience to anyone. Attendees and artists alike. So let's work hand in hand and be mindful of each other.</p>

	</div>
	<div>
	<h3 class="reset-font">Artist Assistant</h3>
		<p>A person that is supporting the artist with their tasks. The assistant must be an official guest of Eurofurence. That artist must officially name their assistant to the Art Show staff on check-in in the Art Show. The assistant will get an voucher that identifies them as an official assistant. An assistant is allowed to handle exhibits but is not allowed to handle any task related to money.

	<h2 id="register" class="uk-column-span">Registration Process</h2>	
	<div>
		<h3 class="reset-font">Step I: Application</h3>
		<p>The application period for Art Show will open on <strong><?= $applications_start ?></strong> and will be accessible up to and <strong>including <?= $applications_end ?></strong>.</p>
		<p>To be eligible for registration as artist or agent, a prior registration for Eurofurence <?= $this->current->year ?> (the event) via the Eurofurence <a href="https://identity.eurofurence.org" title="Eurofurence Identity" target="_blank">Registration System</a> is mandatory. After registering for the event a Art Show application can be <a href="https://help.eurofurence.org/contact/artshow/application" title="Register for the Art Show" target="_blank">submitted here</a>. During Art Show registration, the desired panel and table configuration can be applied for.</p>
		<p>Art Show applications without valid previous event registration will be canceled.</p>
		<p>The Art Show Management will review submissions after the registration period has ended. Status emails about approval, denial, or being put on the waiting list will be sent after the review. Upon approval, the artists'/agents' Eurofurence registration will be updated with a granted package. The package will show up as an extra amount due in the Eurofurence registration once approved and booked. Payment is handled through the Eurofurence registration website. </p>
		<p>Please note that any and all additional obligations like trade fair and exhibition visa, sales tax or income tax declarations have to be fulfilled by the artist. Eurofurence expects all artists to be fully aware of their responsibilities in accordance with applicable law in Germany as well as their country of origin and will neither assist nor advise on these matters. Please set up an appointment with your nearest German embassy or consulate regarding questions about the application process for a trade fair and exhibition visa / Schengen visa.</p>
		<p>The date of registration neither influences the amount of panel or table space nor the chance of any space being allocated to an artist at all.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h3 class="reset-font">Step II: Approval</h3>
		<p>Partaking in the Art Show will be approved on a curated basis.</p>
		<p>Curation will be performed by the Art Show management. Panels and tables be assigned based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:
			<ul>
				<li>Quality, style, media, techniques, space available, past experiences with the artist</li>
				<li>Prominence: the Eurofurence Art Show aims to promote newcomers as well as showcase well known artists.</li>
				<li>New Concepts and showcases: the Eurofurence Art Show is not only a place to sell art, but also to showcase craftsmanship.</li>
				<li>Performance: Art is not only a still object observe but also experience. The Eurofurence Art Show also offers a stage for Art performances. Get in touch with us.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h3 class="reset-font">Step III: Payment</h3>
		<p>After approval, the Art Show registration will be updated to include the fee for the assigned resources. The artist is required to pay the fee at the same time as their respective Eurofurence event registration fee, using their preferred payment method.</p>
		<p>Please pay on time. If payment is overdue, Art Show management may cancel an application and offer the space to the next artist on the waiting list.</p>
		<p>Eurofurence e.V. handles all transactions in Euro (€). Fees must be paid via credit or debit cards. Eurofurence e.V. does not accept PayPal, cash payment or any other method of payment. All payments must be handled through the Eurofurence Registration System. Never send any credit card information via email!</p>
	</div>
	<div>
	<h3 class="reset-font">Step IV: Placement</h3>
		<p>Upon completion of payment, the Art Show management will assign the granted space (panels and tables). The position of the panel assigned is entirely up to the Art Show management. When more than one panel was assigned, all panels will be assigned next to each other. Except for regular and adult themed panels. Those exist of two separate sections. </p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h3 class="reset-font">Waiting List</h3>
		<p>Any application not initially accepted in Step II will be placed on a waiting list curated under the same factors. Information about this status will also be sent to the respective artist or agent after Step IV is completed. Changes to the original applications via email reply to the waiting list information might lead to a reevaluation of the application on the waiting list.</p>
		<p>If panel or table space becomes available again due to the cancellation of another artist, the next best match based on curation from the waiting list will be contacted. There will be limited time to respond, usually only about a week. Once the artist has confirmed their newly assigned space, the (not yet paid) corresponding package will be added to the artists or agents Eurofurence registration, and the payment will be due immediately.</p>
		<p>There might be last-minute sales of canceled panel or table spaces on a first come, first serve basis at the convention itself, starting 12:00 (noon) on Thursday for unclaimed panels or tables.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h3 class="reset-font">Cancellations</h3>
		<p>If an artist/agent can no longer make use their registration, they are asked to contact Art Show management via email in a timely manner. <span class="uk-text-italic">Not doing so is considered unfair to other artists who are on the waiting list and will lead to a lower priority during curation on future registrations to the Art Show.</span></p>
		<p><strong>Packages are non-refundable and cannot be canceled. However, transfers of packages are possible but can only be initiated and approved by the Art Show management. Artists/agents cannot select or nominate individuals from the waiting list for a transfer to bypass the curation process. </strong> If a transfer is desired, please contact the Art Show management with your suggestion. All transfer requests will be considered by the management team, who will have the final say in the approval of the new artist.</p>

			<p><strong>Before applying, please take the following information into account:</strong></p>			
			<li>All fields are mandatory unless specified otherwise.</li>
			<li>For all communication, we will only use the email address from which the application was sent and that of the agent if specified. It is up to you to ensure you retain access to it, or inform us of any changes.</li>
			<li>The contact information provided in the application remains private and will not be disclosed to third parties in accordance with applicable law. The public contact info that you can optionally enter into the Art Show database will be included with the customer receipts so a customer is able to contact you for questions. The email address(es) provided with the application will not be shared.</li>
			<li>Note that <strong>your address is mandatory</strong>. Should there be legal disputes of any sort that cannot be resolved by an email exchange, we may be legally required to pass this address on to law officials or involved parties. Patrons and customers will <strong>not see</strong> your address.</li>
			<li>The number of panels/tables should be what you can fill and afford. We cannot guarantee that this is the number of panels or tables that we can actually allocate to you. Desired panels that we cannot give to you immediately may become available at a later time.</li>
			<li>Available panels and tables will be distributed after March 30th. If we have not received your application by then, you may end up on the waiting list.</li>

		<ul>
			<li>Be sure to fill out your application truthfully and correctly. Incomplete applications will be rejected.</li>
			<p><strong>What happens after that? Are changes possible? Can new panels be ordered?</strong></p>
			<li>The panels that are confirmed by the Art Show are yours. We will not take them away or redistribute them. You can plan your final layout for the show.</li>
			<li>You may apply (or try to book additional panels if you need them) at any time even after the registration has been closed. However, the panels will most likely be gone by then, and you will end up on the waiting list behind the people that have applied before the deadline. We cannot guarantee that you will get a panel, but some may become available for transfer.</li>
			<li>Changes to the assignment (adding or (trying to) remove panels/tables, or changing the agent) require manual changes to the memberships of the parties involved and are thus subject to availability. Please try to apply only for a reasonable amount of panels and think early about getting an agent as we cannot guarantee that we can fulfill all change requests.</li>

	<h2 id="costs" class="uk-column-span">Participation and Cost</h2>
	<p class="uk-column-span">You may display <strong>only art that you created yourself</strong> and not some you just happen to own. The show is not a market for selling leftover purchases or similar. Exceptions may only be made in rare cases, e.g. for Charity.</p>
	<p class="uk-column-span">The name you or your agent are registered under must be the same as the one you register for the convention. (The artist name shown on the bidsheets can be freely selected.) The Art Show signup template requires your (or your agent's, if you don't participate yourself) Eurofurence registration number.</p>
	<div>
		<ul>
			<li>The fee only needs to be paid after you have been accepted to the Art Show and been assigned a final number of panels and/or tables. You only pay for those panels/tables that you actually get, not the ones you request. Payment is due through the Eurofurence Registration system up front. If you fail to pay, your panel/table assignment is void and will be offered to the next artist.</li>
			<li>The panel/table assignments are <strong>not shareable</strong>: Each space (application and acceptance) is valid for one artist only (with the exception of collaborations), and comes at a minimum of a half panel or a half table.</li>
			<li>The panel/table assignments are <strong>not transferable</strong> to avoid speculation. If you have valid reason to give up your assignment, please <a href="https://help.eurofurence.org/contact/artshow" title="Contact the Art Show" target="_blank">contact the Art Show managers</a> and we'll try to find an artist on the waiting list to whom you can pass your assignment.</li>
			<li>The fee is <strong>not refundable</strong> after assignments have been determined. If you find yourself unable to participate in the Art Show personally for some reason (after applying, being accepted, and paying the fee), you can always assign an agent of your choice to handle the art for you (see below). If you have valid reason to give up your assignment altogether, see the previous bullet point.</li>
			
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div>
		<ul>
			<li>You or your agent need to be <strong>registered with Eurofurence</strong> and participate in the convention. You or your agent are responsible for hanging the art, taking it down, and collecting the money from sales.</li>
			<li><strong>You have to arrange getting your art to the show by yourself.</strong> The Art Show does not allow art to be directly sent in via mail. If you find yourself unable to transport your artwork to Eurofurence, please find an agent to handle it for you. Any cost arising from your transportation, customs etc. must be determined and paid by yourself. We can not offer any advice or assistance on these subjects.</li>  
			<li><strong>There is no insurance involved.</strong> Of course there is security present to guard the Art Show. There is a computer system to keep track of exhibits. And of course the managers will help you identify the perpetrator in any case of damaged artwork. However, the Art Show cannot be held accountable for matters of theft, vandalism, or accidents. It is up to you to file claims against identified or unidentified offenders.</li>
			<li>Eurofurence just arranges sales between artists and buyers. Any financial obligations resulting from those sales (like taxes) have to be managed and fulfilled by you. You do not enter a sales contract with Eurofurence or the Eurofurence Art Show, but with the buyer.</li>

			<li><strong>The application period for artists will open on <?= $applications_start ?> and will be accessible up to and including <?= $applications_end ?>.</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Panel distribution:</strong> After the deadline, we will look at the numbers of available panels/tables vs. the number of panels/tables requested, and assign space to each artist. This may or may not be the amount of space you have asked for, depending on how much demand there is.</li>
			<li><strong>Art production:</strong> You will need to create art. The exhibit must physically exist and be complete to be suitable for the show (e.g. no YCHs). The art must be in a displayable state (i.e. framed) at the time of the show.</li>
			<li><strong>Online database:</strong> You will be handed a login for an online database. You need this to enter the required information for each piece of art you want to exhibit, and to print bidsheets.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Getting the art to the show:</strong> If you attend Eurofurence yourself, you just bring the art with you. Otherwise, you will need to appoint an <strong>agent</strong> who brings the art and picks it up again (see below).</li>
			<li><strong>Hanging the art:</strong> We will provide you with the panels and hooks for hanging, as well as sticky tape for the bidsheets. It is up to you or your agent to hang the art together with the accompanying bidsheets.</li>
			<li><strong>Leave packaging:</strong> It is possible for you to leave the packaging for the art in the Art Show. If the art is sold, the buyer will receive the packaging for the transport home.</li>
			<li><strong>During the Art Show:</strong> You don't need to do anything during the Art Show opening times. You may enjoy the convention, or sit in the Dealers' Den (please use the separate application process &ndash; Dealers' Den tables are not part of the Art Show) for commercial activity. The Art Show will do all the required handling for you, up to the sales.</li>
			<li><strong>Picking up unsold art:</strong> If any of your exhibits remains unsold (or was not for sale), you or your agent need to pick it up after the show is closed.</li>
			<li><strong>Picking up revenue:</strong> When the sales are done, the artists will receive an immediate payout on site. This is a separate step from picking up unsold art.</li>

	<h2 id="deadlines" class="uk-column-span">Deadlines</h2>
	<p class="uk-column-span">The application / registration process has a number of dates and times you need to be aware of. If you don't meet these deadlines, you may cause grievances, delays, or even endanger your participation. Note that some dates for deadlines will be announced later when the convention's schedule has been finalized.</p>
	<div>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Applications need to be sent by 22th of March.</strong> It is possible to apply for Art Show space after that, but we will have distributed all available panels and tables by then, so unless there are more panels available than needed, you will end up on the waiting list. There is a chance that you get in, but you will not have a guaranteed space.</li>
			<li><strong>You can retract your application until panels have been assigned.</strong> After that time, the panels/tables are yours to keep. You can open a ticket with the Art Show if a transfer is unavoidable, but we do not guarantee that a transfer is possible.</li>
			<li><strong>You can enter data into the online database until shortly before the con.</strong> The exact date will be emailed with the regular info emails for the Art Show. The database is taken offline for use at the con site after that. You can still enter data at the con, but there will be waiting times and queues.</li>
			<li><strong>You (or your agent) may hang art on the opening day (recommended), or the morning of the day after.</strong></li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>You (or your agent) need to pick up your unsold art on the last con day.</strong> Artists may pick up unsold art at the announced time. You need to check out unsold art; get your checkout sheet at the Art Show counter (look for the signs, we provide an extra queue).<br/>
			<li>The Art Show cannot store any art that you leave behind. If you have any trouble keeping the date, talk to us for a different pickup date. We cannot guarantee the safety of abandoned art.</li>
			<li><strong>You (or your agent) need to pick up your money after the sales.</strong> The money from actual sales will be paid out after all sales have concluded. Therefore, the artist payout depends on the duration of the sales. We may require you to be flexible with respect to the exact payout time, but if you absolutely cannot make it, please contact us as early as possible so an alternative time slot can be arranged for you.</li>

	<h2 id="agents" class="uk-column-span">For Agents</h2>
	<p class="uk-column-span">It is generally best practice for an artist to personally come to Eurofurence to hang their art. Sometimes however, an artist cannot make it due to time, money, or distance issues. In these cases, that artist may appoint an agent to handle the art, the payment, and the revenue for them.</p>
	<p class="uk-column-span">Note: <strong>It is not possible to send exhibits to the Art Show by mail.</strong> If you find yourself unable to transport your artwork yourself, please find an agent to handle it for you.</p>
	<p class="uk-column-span">"Agent" refers to the person that actually comes to Eurofurence and works with us in getting the art displayed, sold, and picked up. The agent will handle money for you, so it must be a person you trust.</p> 
	<p class="uk-column-span">The Art Show must know about your agent. We cannot just have a stranger come in with your stuff and hang your art and collect money. This may as well be a thief that tries to sell stolen goods! <strong>Only designated agents may pick up art or money.</strong></p>
	<div>
		<ul>
			<li>When you apply with an agent, you need to fill in the agent contact data as well as your own. Do not fill the line asking for your Eurofurence registration number (which you will not have), but fill the line asking for your agent's registration number, so we can confirm their identity via their badge.</li>
			<li>You can only have one agent.</li>
			<li>An agent, on the other hand, can perform their service for several artists.</li>
			<li>The agent is responsible for everything, including paying your Art Show fee. This is because the fee is added to the Eurofurence ticket fee, and it's the agent who has that ticket as they are coming to Eurofurence instead of you. You will thus need to reimburse them.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div>
		<ul>
			<li>The Eurofurence Art Show does not monitor your transactions with your agent (e.g. them transferring the sales revenue to you). We will treat the agent as if they were you.</li>
			<li>All Eurofurence Art Show communication will be sent to your agent as well as to you, under the email you provide with the application. It is up to you to agree on who is going to answer upcoming questions or react to issues.</li>
			<li>If you need to change your agent, or get an agent at all after you have already applied, send us a ticket. Note that this will also require us re-booking the Art Show fee to the new agent.</li>

	<h2 id="selling" class="uk-column-span">Bidsheets and Selling Art</h2>
	<div>
		<ul>
			<li>The Art Show allows you to sell your art. Please note that the show doesn't buy art, or sell art to bidders. The Art Show acts exclusively as a mediator in a contract between artist/owner and buyer (selling on commission).</lI>
			<li>Each piece of art will have a bidsheet hanging next to the piece which provides information on the artwork, the artist, and more. The bidsheet is used for identification of the art, and for purchasing art. A piece of art is marked as "not for sale" by a special no-sale bidsheet that does not provide the purchase-related part.</lI>
			<li>If you don't want to sell a piece, you simply use the no-sale bidsheet by marking it as not-for-sale in the online database, which will automatically select the correct bidsheet. This sheet still gives the visitor all relevant information about the art and the artist, but does not set a price or allow bidding on this piece.</lI>
			<li>If you want to sell your art, you use the sales bidsheet. Here, you need to state a minimum price, which is essentially the smallest sum you want to sell the piece for.</lI>
			<li>Bidsheets are available through the online database. If you do not have a printer available, you may print them at the convention; however, it is strongly recommended that you print bidsheets before the con to avoid extensive wait times.</lI>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div>
		<ul>
			<li>Visitors of the art show may bid on "for sale" pieces by pasting a bid sticker on the corresponding bidsheet. The first bid must meet the minimum price, consecutive bids must exceed the previous bid. The piece is sold to the highest bidder at the end of the show.</lI>
			<li>After the closing of the show, the money for winning bids will be collected from the respective bidders in exchange for the art pieces they won and paid for. Once sales all have concluded the collected money for their sold pieces will be handed out to the artists/owners. This is done for practical reasons: Eurofurence does not act as a buyer or reseller. Eurofurence will try to mediate in cases of problematic purchase, but it is up to the artist to verify and claim their money.</lI>
			<li>Unsold pieces (having no bid) or "Not for sale" pieces are returned to the owner at the end of the art show.</lI>
			<li>Please note that any and all additional obligations like sales tax or income tax declarations have to be fulfilled by the artist/owner. Eurofurence expects all sellers to be fully aware of their responsibilities in accordance with applicable law in Germany as well as their country of origin and will neither assist nor advise on these matters.</lI>

			<li>You can leave the packaging with the Art Show during the exhibition.</lI>
			<li>During setup, you will be given pairs of numbered labels to connect art and packaging, one of which must be hung next to the bidsheet and the other one (with the same number) stuck to the packaging. This allows us to 
			store the packaging elsewhere.</lI>
			<li>You need to bundle your packaging in a way that we can easily see what parts belong together (e.g. styrofoam padding, a plastic sheet, and a box). Otherwise we are not able to match the packaging (parts) with the exhibit.</lI>

	<h2 id="requirements">Technical Requirements</h2>
	<p>The Eurofurence Art Show provides panels and hooks for hanging art as well as tables. The panels are sturdy wooden constructs with pre-drilled pegboard sides where hooks can be inserted. All panels are usable from both sides. The managers lay out the panels in the room to meet a number of requirements. Panels are assigned and cannot be chosen freely.  The artists will normally not be able to request a certain layout (you can ask to be placed next to a friend; we try to honor these requests, but don't guarantee it).</p>
	<p>Since 2024 we allow the installation of custom light solutions and also decoration.</p>
	<p>A full technical documentation and guide on our panels can be found here: <a href="files/Art_Show_Guide_to_Decoration_and_Lighting_Options_(V1.0-20.08.2024).pdf" title="Guide to Decoration and Lighting Options (V1.0-20.08.2024)">Guide to Decoration and Lighting Options (V1.0-20.08.2024)</a></p>

	<div>
		<ul>
			<li>The art must exist. The Eurofurence Art Show can only display and sell what has actually been physically produced. For example, YCH offers, vouchers, or promises of additional items (like "I will create fursuit gloves in addition to the fursuit head that you are buying") do not comprise existing items, and cannot be offered in the Art Show. Photos of your art are not sufficient (e.g. a photo of a fursuit to sell that fursuit), the exhibit must be actually present.</li>
			<li>We distinguish between original art, hand-colored prints, limited prints, and unlimited prints. We prefer original artwork for display. Photography, 3D computer graphics and digital artwork count as (limited) prints, since there is no physical original. We discourage the display of unlimited prints (those should be sold at the Dealers' Den).</li>
			<li>For all prints a minimum printing quality is required: i.e. washed-out low-resolution copies of artifact-riddled jpg images are not fit for display.</li>
			<li>The art must be prepared for display before getting it to the Art Show at your own cost. Eurofurence provides panels and hooks for hanging the art as well as tables for pieces that cannot be hung, but no further materials. The Art Show may supply some standard frames and materials in emergency cases (e.g. if your frame breaks during transport) for a small fee, but these are not guaranteed to be available. In addition, if your art needs special arrangements for hanging, please clear the requirements with the managers beforehand.</li>
			<li>Flat art (images, drawings, paintings) for the Art Show must be framed, matted, or mounted by the artist. A piece of cardboard is not a mat, a clear plastic binder is not a frame. Please, show your artwork some respect by giving it the proper framing treatment. (Art that is already display-ready, like alubonds or canvas prints, do not require an additional frame of course.)</li>
			<li>Any medium is acceptable (unless it's perishable, dangerous, or widely regarded unsuitable for presentation by the patrons, i.e. real fur): watercolor, oils, pastels, pencils, clay sculptures, glass etchings, plush characters, whatever. If it's large or requires special support/hanging, check with the managers first whether it is physically possible to display. For three-dimensional art you have to request a table instead of (or in addition to) a panel!</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div>
		<ul>
			<li>The exhibit must not afflict the exhibition space: It must not drip oils on the table, ooze noxious fumes, or rub off colors. It must also not make annoying or permanent noise.</li>
			<li>An art piece shown at the same show should not duplicate the motif of another piece, e.g. it is not desirable to have two prints of the same image in the same year (even if the pieces in question differ in size and framing) unless the duplication is part of the artistic statement. If you want to offer the same image multiple times, please get a Dealers' Den space.</li>
			<li>If the exhibit is powered, it must use batteries; power sockets of any kind are not available. You are responsible for changing or charging the batteries when necessary; the Art Show crew will not do that for you. Generally we discourage powered displays for safety reasons. If you want to display "active" art, please contact us beforehand.</li>
			<li>Only the panels, tables, etc., that are provided by Eurofurence are allowed as display space. If you need some kind of special stand, contact us beforehand whether this is possible. It might not be feasible to set up e.g. a fursuit rack because of space issues, security concerns, or the simple possibility that it topples over and damages other art.</li>
			<li>You must not use any sticky tape – beyond what we supply – nor any other tool or sticky stuff on the panel. The panel surfaces are pretty delicate, and will be damaged by unauthorized materials including paints. (It should be obvious that it is not allowed to write or paint on the panels.)</li>
			<li>For identification purposes, the art should bear a (readable) sticker on the reverse side stating the artist's or agent's name and the name of the piece (Latin alphabet preferred). This is not enforced, however it will help us identify your art e.g. in case a bidsheet gets damaged, displaced or lost.</li>

	<h2 id="prohibited" class="uk-column-span">Contents / Prohibited Topics</h2>
	<p class="uk-column-span">The following requirements cover technical aspects of the artwork and the manner of display.</p>
	<div>
		<ul>
			<li>The general topic is "anthropomorphic art" (furry). That makes some kind of animal connection mandatory. Art that features just humans does not count as furry (even if you count the fact that humans are animals too). Wildlife/animal art is permitted but actual anthropomorphic art will take precedence. Centaurs or other mixtures of fully human and fully animal elements are allowed too.</lI>
			<li>Art in any form that promotes or encourages discrimination, harassment, or violence based on race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, religion, or nationality is strictly prohibited.</lI>
			<li>Due to German law, absolutely no Nazi symbols are allowed. That means no swastika, no SS runes, no Third Reich flags. This holds true even in other contexts: a swastika as an Indian symbol of luck still counts as a forbidden symbol.</lI>
			<li>Any exhibit referencing themes or symbols (i.e. dogwhistling or intentional obfuscation) of the Third Reich even when not directly prohibited by law is still frowned upon by the convention and will likely see the exhibit being rejected.</lI>
			<li>This also applies to any other symbols of forbidden organizations according to &sect;86 and &sect;86a of the German Penal Code (StGB) or symbols relating to groups associated with the "alt furry" movement.</lI>
			<li>No excessive violence and cruelty (even in nonsexual context). Violence in general is allowed on a reasonable level, including blood, gore, killing, or hunting (see the age rating section below). If you are in doubt about that rule, show the picture to the Art Show managers first.</lI>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div>
		<ul>
			<li>No depictions of rape or other non-consensual violence in combination with sexual content. Bondage or sub/dom depictions are allowed. Consensual sex of any kind, regardless of species and gender, is allowed (unless covered by the rules below).</lI>
			<li>No underage characters in sexual situations / pedophilia / "cub porn". We are aware that this is a difficult rule since the actual age of drawn characters can be difficult to assess, especially with furry characters of different species or cartoony, "childlike" designs. Appearances count; hypothetical backstories are irrelevant for the age assessment.</lI>
			<li>No zoophilia / sodomy / bestiality involving humans or largely human-like characters (e.g. anime catgirls, elves, or centaurs) with plain animals or largely non-morphic furries (four-legged, feral) is allowed. Other (non-human) species-transcending sexual activity is generally allowed (including feral-only or furries with ferals).</lI>
			<li>No toilet activities. That includes scat, watersports, diapers in use, vomit, or any related fetish work, which is not suitable for a wide and varied public.</lI>
			<li>Art for sale that is made for body contact, like fursuits, plushies, or underwear, must only be offered brand new. Used items are not allowed for hygienic reasons.</lI>
		</ul>

<section class="uk-column-1-2@l">
	<h2 id="ownership" class="uk-column-span">IP and Ownership Rights</h2>
	<p class="uk-column-span">These rules govern the requirements for artwork in relation to the intellectual property of the motif in question.</p>
	<div>
		<ul>
			<li>No use of copyrighted/trademarked characters. Large companies are protective of their franchises and generally do not like their characters being sold by someone else. While the usage of copyrighted characters is theoretically allowed in the context of parodies or derivative artistic work, we do not want you to get into possible legal trouble if your art is deemed to cross those boundaries.</lI>
			<li>Note that a style cannot be copyrighted, only the character itself, so your own characters in a signature style are still allowed.</lI>
			<li> We like artists to display their own characters and creations. If you use other people's characters, you should ask for the approval of the creator. If you e.g. do a commission of a personal character for someone, and want to sell the original painting (to someone else), you should keep in mind the sensibilities of your customer.</lI>
			<li>We recommend that you clarify your handling of this kind of situation in your terms of service before taking commissions you wish to use in this way, so no surprises pop up in the handling of this type of art.</lI>
			</ul>
		</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<ul>
			<li>No traces or "heavily referenced" images. The art should be your own work, done with confidence and skill. Of course we realize that tracing and referencing has its place in the learning process, but if you are not yet able to create works on your own, you should reconsider participating in an art show. With thousands of patrons, active on all kinds of forums and galleries, the trace will most likely be discovered, and that is a very embarrassing thing.</lI>
			<li>Trying to pass and resell such traced work as your own is also widely regarded offensive behavior.</lI>
			<li>No AI generated images. AI generation is a controversial topic and widely thought to infringe the rights of artists whose imagery has been used to train the algorithm.</lI>
			<li>The Eurofurence Art Show is aware that many tools in image editing programs nowadays are based on AI support and those tools are of course still permitted as long as the overall result ultimately shows your own skill set.</lI>
			<li>It is obvious that it is not always possible to recognize AI art as such, so we would count on the honesty of artists to not present auto-generated stuff.</lI>

	<h2 id="agerating" class="uk-column-span">Age Rating in the Art Show</h2>
	<div>
		<p>Since some guests of Eurofurence may not want to look at the more adult part of the show, and some "clean" artists may not feel comfortable to be displayed next to explicit artwork, the show will be divided into two separate sections – a General Section for clean and slightly erotic art, and an Adult Section for adult artwork. That way, any visitor can decide by themselves where to go, and artists don't need to worry about what will be displayed on the panels next to theirs.</p>
		<p>To prepare the setup, an artist needs to include with their application email the number of panels or tables <em>per section</em>.</p>
		<ul>
			<p><strong>Artwork appropriate for the General Section:</strong></p>
			<li>At most, tasteful nudity, moderate or cartoony violence. No emphasis on sexuality or highlighted/exaggerated endowment. No hard violence.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div>
		<ul>
			<p><strong>Artwork requiring to use the Adult Section:</strong></p>
			<li>Lewd nudity (male erection, sexual posing), strong suggestions of violence or sex (impending rape, suggested copulation, insinuated bloody violence), direct sexual activity, violence, gore, death/dying, foul language.</li>
			<li>Hardcore and fetish work, gross activities, just-barely-permittable violence.</li>
			<li>Note that the rules completely exclude some themes, which are therefore not suitable even for the Adult Section.</li>
			<li>The two Art Show Sections will be separated physically. The size of the sections will depend on the number of applications.</li>
			<li>Regardless of rules, the Art Show managers have the final say in what is allowed and what is not. Note that in spite of all those rules, the Eurofurence Art Show allows a lot of explicit, adult, or even fetish artwork. To avoid conflicts about objectionable and offensive artwork, the managers reserve the right to refuse displaying individual pieces of art.</li>
