<h1>Restaurant Options</h1>
<p>Everyone deserves to enjoy good food during the con. However, due to allergies, intolerances, or ethical choices, some furries may have limited dining options. To support them, we've created a map highlighting restaurants that offer vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options.</p>
