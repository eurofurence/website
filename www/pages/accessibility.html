	<h1>Accessibility</h1>
	<p>Everyone deserves the right to participate fully in Eurofurence and our community - regardless of needs or disabilities. Below, attendees can find details on the steps we’re taking to ensure our convention is as accessible and inclusive as possible.</p>
</section>

<section class="uk-column-1-2@l">
	<div>
		<h2>Queuing</h2>
		<p>Attendees who are disabled, rely on a wheelchair, or temporarily injured in a way that limits their ability to walk or stand for longer periods of time are eligible for a Priority Access Wearable (P.A.W.).</p>
		<p>P.A.W.s are available at the ConOps Info Desk, and enable our security team to guide attendees inside an event immediately as soon as the command to open doors is given.</p>
		<p>Having a disability ID or medical certificate present when requesting a P.A.W. is helpful and recommended.</p>
		<p>For special cases or additional questions, please <a href="https://help.eurofurence.org/contact/awareness" target="_blank">contact our Awareness & Inclusion Team</a> - we’re here to help.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>Seating</h2>
		<p>All shows and events are wheelchair accessible.</p>
		<p>Dedicated seating is typically reserved for wheelchair users and physically disabled attendees - just ask a member of queue security at the event for assistance.</p>
		<p>For detailed information on overall venue accessibility, please visit the <a href="https://www.cch.de/en/visit/barrier-free-access" target="_blank">CCH website</a>.</p>

	<div>
		<h2>Flashing Lights</h2>
		<p>Please note that certain events, such as dances, the opening ceremony and the Paw Pet Show, may include flashing lights and other intense visual effects.</p> 
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>Venue</h2>
		<p>The Congress Center Hamburg (CCH) is fully barrier-free. All rooms are wheelchair accessible, and 18 designated disabled parking spaces are available on the premises. For complete venue accessibility details, please refer to the <a href="https://www.cch.de/en/visit/barrier-free-access" target="_blank">CCH website</a>.</p>
		<p>The train and U-Bahn stations at Dammtor and Stephansplatz are barrier-free, and have lifts provided for easy access.
However, occasional technical issues and outages can occur. To check the status of the lifts and other facilities at these stations at any given time, please visit the <a href="https://www.hvv.de/en/lifts" target="_blank">HVV website</a>.</p>

	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>The Dealers' Den</h2>
		<p>The Dealers’ Den is a bustling, high-traffic area, and as such offers priority access to attendees with mobility or standing limitations. In general, please be aware it can be crowded, noisy, and potentially overwhelming.</p>
		<p>If assistance is required, visit the Dealers’ Den Help Desk, or speak to a Eurofurence Security team member near the entrance. For more information on how we’re working to make the Dealer’s Den an amazing and accessible experience for everyone, visit <a href="https://www.eurofurence.org/EF29/dealersden/visiting" target="_blank">our guide</a> (this page will be made available in the weeks before the convention).</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>The Quiet Room</h2>
		<p>Need a break from the noise and crowds? The Quiet Room offers a peaceful, low-stimulation environment for rest and recovery.</p>
		<p>While the Quiet Room is available and accessible to all attendees, please follow the posted rules to help maintain a calm atmosphere. The Quiet Room’s location can be found in the Con Book, or on the map in the Eurofurence app.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>Service Animals</h2>
		<p>In short:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Dogs and other pet animals are not allowed in the CCH</li>
			<li>Only fully certified assistant dogs are allowed</li>
			<li>Relevant certifications have to be verified by the CCH upon entry to the building </li>
			<li>Please register your assistant dog in advance via mail or telephone at the CCH</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In detail:</p>
		<p>Due to venue regulations, pet animals - including dogs without zippers - are not permitted inside the CCH.</p>
		<p>The sole exception to this rule is for fully certified assistance dogs and owners that meet the requirements of the <a href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/ahundv/BJNR243600022.html" target="_blank">German Assistenzhundeverordnung (AHundV)</a>. A valid photo ID and certificate (per Att. 9 AHundV) must be presented for on-site verification at the CCH Info Desk.</p>
		<p>For attendees that know in advance that they would like to attend Eurofurence with a service animal - please register in advance vial mail at <a href="mailto:info@cch.de">info@cch.de</a>, or via telephone at +49 40 3569 2000.</p>
		<p>Without proper certification and verification, entry with animals will not be allowed. Violations may result in removal from the venue and expulsion from the convention.</p>

		<h2>Accompanying Persons</h2>
		<p>If persistent personal assistance is required during the event, one person may accompany any one attendee free of charge.</p>
		<p>To qualify, please submit proof - such as a German disability ID card with a ‘B’ symbol - and a short explanation of the need for assistance through our <a href="https://help.eurofurence.org/contact/reg" target="_blank">contact form</a>.</p>

	<div>
		<h2>Gender-neutral Bathrooms</h2>
		<p>Both gender-neutral and gender-coded bathrooms will be available and clearly marked throughout the venue.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>Sign Language Interpretation and Live Captioning</h2>
		<p>Currently, we are unable to provide sign language interpretation at events. This is, however, a strong focus for improvement in the future. If interpretation is required, please let us know in advance via our <a href="https://help.eurofurence.org/contact/awareness" target="_blank">contact form</a>.</p>
		<p>We do aim to provide subtitles for some main shows, but cannot guarantee availability for all events.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>Our Website</h2>
		<p>Eurofurence is committed to making our website as accessible as possible, and strive to meet the WCAG 2.2 AA standard. The vast majority of content is accessible, but some limitations remain -</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Modals are not fully compatible with keyboard navigation</li>
			<li>Menus cannot be expanded using only a keyboard</li>
			<li>Some visual elements (like the ‘registration statistics’ graphics) may not be accessible for users with specific disabilities</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We are actively working to address these issues, and aim to make all aspects of our website accessible in the future.</p>
