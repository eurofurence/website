		<h2>Space … the final frontier …</h2>
		<p><strong>These are the dances of Eurofurence 29. Their continuing mission: to explore strange new sounds … to seek out new beats, new rhythmic revelations … to boldly go where no fur has grooved before.</strong></p>
		<p>We are calling all DJs, beat captains, and interstellar sound engineers: The Eurofurence 29 Dance Stage is preparing for liftoff — and we need <strong>you</strong> on board.</p>
		<p>What would an expedition amongst the stars be without the perfect soundtrack? We are seeking talented, passionate DJs to take our attendees on an unforgettable voyage through music. Whether you are a master of galactic house, stellar synthwave, cosmic trance, or just love to make people move, this is your moment to shine.</p>

		<h2>What Is the Deal?</h2>
		<p>You will get a 1 to 2.5-hour slot on our Dance Stage, equipped with pro-level gear and a crew of technicians ready to support your set. We take care of the light, you take care of a sea of paws ready to dance under the glow of digital stars. Want to go even further? Let us know if you’re up for spinning at the Dead Dog Party or the Arts & Crafts Party — each with their own unique orbit of fun.</p>

		<h2>What Are We Looking For?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Live Experience</strong><br />
				You have performed for real crowds and know how to read a room (or a starbase) …
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Reliability & Flexibility</strong><br />
				Schedules can shift — space is weird like that. We need DJs who can deal with changes at warp-speed …
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Energy & Passion</strong><br />
				It’s not just about mixing tracks — it’s about binging joy, energy, and that extra sparkle that makes a set unforgettable …
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Optional Bonus</strong><br />
				Thematic flair! Be wildly creative. Think outside the galaxy …
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>We are not just looking for someone to press play. We are looking for someone who can command the decks like a captain commands their ship. Someone who understands that a dance at Eurofurence isn’t just another dance but a full-on experience.</p>
		<p>So — Do you know how to entertain the crowd? Can you make a dance floor feel like a hyperspace jump? Are you ready to drop the bass into a wormhole and send us hurtling through the cosmos?</p>
		<p>If yes — submit your details, show us your sound, and prepare for launch.</p>
