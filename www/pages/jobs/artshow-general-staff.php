<p><strong>Make Eurofurence happen and be a part of Eurofurence.</strong></p>

<p>We’re always excited to welcome multi-talented people to our team, but we also make sure everyone can shine in their individual field of expertise. Our Art Show team works in smaller sub-groups, where each member takes on the tasks they love and contributes in the way that suits them best.</p>
<p>We will provide mentoring and guidance for processes and programs.</p>
<p>General staff is the gateway to grow into specialized positions.</p>

<h3>Who are we?</h3>

<p>We are the Eurofurence Art Show — the largest Art Show at Furry conventions in the world and the most innovative one as well. We provide a space for the artistic community of the Furry fandom to showcase their craftsmanship and talent, whether through traditional analog media or new frontiers in the digital realm.</p>
<p>We connect customers with artists and handle sales. We also offer a platform for fresh ideas and support the exchange of knowledge. Our goal is make browsing art an inspiring and enchanting experience, hosting events that allow guests to encounter art from new perspectives</p>
<p>Our team is made up of creative, project-driven people who love turning ideas into reality. Mutual support and openness to new ideas are at the heart of what we do. By joining the Art Show team, you can discover a unique and immersive side of Eurofurence — helping to bring the convention to life while becoming an essential part of it.</p>

<h3>Your Job</h3>

<p>Our general staff handle a wide range of tasks, both behind the scenes and on the ground. Some are more conceptual—like planning and making sure each event has everything it needs—while others are hands-on, such as setting up the Art Show or preparing equipment. On top of that, the team is always there for artists and guests, ready to help out with questions or any problems that come up.</p>

<h3>Your profile</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Language skills:</strong> being fluent enough in English to communicate with guests and the team. Being fluent in German is a plus.</li>
    <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> you can be trusted to keep up with deadlines and schedules. Working in this role means holding a position of real responsibility, where mistakes need to be addressed and resolved immediately.</li>
    <li><strong>Personality:</strong> Energetic and project driven. Structured and communicative.</li>
    <li>Time requirements:</strong> Depends on the Art Show projects you take care of. Estimated time fluctuates week to week. The closer EF comes, the more time is usually required. The basics for keeping up are:
        <ul>
            <li>Past EF until April: Approx 1 hour each week</li>
            <li>April to June: 2 hours each week</li>
            <li>July until EF: 2-5 hours/week (task dependent)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Software skills:</strong> We use a lot of web based tools to organize ourselves, such as Cloud-Services, Task Boards and Wikis. For the basic participation, no programming skills are needed but welcome.</li>
    <li><strong>Social skills:</strong> Being polite and calm even in challenging situations is key to acting professionally. </li>
    <li><strong>Stress resilience:</strong> medium. The closer Eurofurence gets, the more demanding work becomes. Issues need to be resolved and problems taken care of. That sometimes requires unscheduled work so deadlines can be met. </li>
    <li><strong>Basic legal understanding:</strong> Willing to understand and respect European copyright and privacy laws.</li>
    <li><strong>Communication:</strong> The Art Show team meets monthly during the winter. From April onward, bi-weekly online meetings are held to keep everyone synchronized with ongoing projects. The team is highly active, and response times are consistently short.</li>
    <li><strong>Answer turn-around time:</strong> Off-season: 1-3 days at worst. 3 months until EF: daily.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Your responsibility as team member</h3>

<ul>
    <li>You show initiative and take care of tasks that become available in your field of expertise.</li>
    <li>You work hand in hand with the rest of the team and keep the team up to date about the progress.</li>
    <li>You maintain usable documentation for your task.</li>
    <li>Get in touch with other staff if you need help. You ask for help when you run into problems. </li>
    <li>You understand that communication is key and that deadlines must be met.</li>
