<p>The Art Show program and database currently in use have been developed many years
ago and require a thorough revamp. The following goals will determine the future code
base:</p>

<p><strong>Reworked art administration:</strong> User, artist, and agent roles as well as exhibit data shall
be reviewed and extended.</p>

<p><strong>Panel assignment integration:</strong> Functionalities currently performed outside of the Art
Show program in spreadsheets and text documents need to be integrated with the Art
Show program for ease of access.</p>

<p><strong>Panel placement:</strong> The placement of artists’ panels within the show layout (and the
layout itself) should be editable in the Art Show program.</p>

<p><strong>Payment:</strong> The Art Show aims to transition from cash-only payments to a fully digital
payment system between customers and artists.</p>

<p>A complete project documentation is available, and a team of programmers is ready to
assist. We are looking for a product owner to coordinate the development of the new Art
Show Management tool. Bringing your own programming team to collaborate is also an
option.</p>

<h3>Who are we?</h3>

<p>We are the Eurofurence Art Show — the largest Art Show at Furry conventions in the world and the most innovative one as well. We provide a space for the artistic community of the Furry fandom to showcase their craftsmanship and talent, whether through traditional analog media or new frontiers in the digital realm.</p>
<p>We connect customers with artists and handle sales. We also offer a platform for fresh ideas and support the exchange of knowledge. Our goal is make browsing art an inspiring and enchanting experience, hosting events that allow guests to encounter art from new perspectives</p>
<p>Our team is made up of creative, project-driven people who love turning ideas into reality. Mutual support and openness to new ideas are at the heart of what we do. By joining the Art Show team, you can discover a unique and immersive side of Eurofurence — helping to bring the convention to life while becoming an essential part of it.</p>
<p>We will provide mentoring and guidance for processes and programs.</p>

<h4>Your Job</h4>

team and incorporate the feedback into the development process. Maintaining and
updating the project documentation will also be your responsibility.</p>

copyright and privacy laws.</li>
    <li><strong>Communication:</strong> The Art Show team meets monthly during the winter. From
April onward, bi-weekly online meetings are held to keep everyone synchronized
