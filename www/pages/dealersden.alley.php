			<li><strong>Compliance:</strong> The Dealers' Den team may instruct artists and dealers to remove material, merchandise or anything else on display or vacate their table if compliance issues arise.</li>

	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Table Usage:</strong> Do not occupy more than one table for your display or sales activities.</li>
			<li><strong>Courtesy:</strong> Maintain a polite demeanor towards fellow artists and attendees.</li>

To prove meeting this class, they must have a certificate, usually printed on the label. <strong>Please note</strong> that applying a flame-retardant spray to otherwise uncertified materials does not make them certified. The treated material (e.g., tablecloth) would need to undergo a <strong>full certification process</strong>, including all necessary tests, to verify its flame-retardant properties and receive such a certification.</li>
					<li>Dealers are responsible for providing proof of certification of any tablecloth, fabric or other materials used for covering or decoration purposes. Proof can be provided in printed or digital form. If an artist or dealer cannot provide sufficient proof of the flame-retardant certification for any material upon request, the material or item has to be removed.</li>
					<li>Tablecloths and/or similar are not provided by Eurofurence.</li>
					<li>Activities that cause dirt or contamination are not allowed.</li>
					<li>There is a strict <strong>no smoking</strong> policy in the whole CCH. This also includes vaping.</li>
					<li>Any equipment that produces an open flame or excessive heat is not allowed.</li>
				</ul>
			<li><strong>End of Sales:</strong> Artists are expected to clear their tables if they have completed their sales activities for the day, allowing opportunities for others</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	
	<div>
		<h2>Preferred Merchandise</h2>
		<p>Since Eurofurence is a convention centered around furry culture, merchandise should appeal to attendees who are fans of this genre. Typical items for sale include (but are not limited to) commissions (e.g. badges or sketchbooks), original furry artwork featuring characters with two, four, or any number of limbs or body configurations, as well as prints, digital media, furry-themed jewelry, fursuit materials, and plushies made of faux fur.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
		<h2>Intellectual Property and Fan Art</h2>
		<p>The display and sale of fan art or items based on movies, television series, games, or other third-party intellectual property are subject to certain restrictions:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Any item that is prohibited for sale is also not permitted for display, giveaway, advertisement or delivery. Items generally prohibited for sale include, but are not limited to:
				<ul>
					<li>weapons and weapon look-alikes,</li>
					<li>items and symbols of forbidden organizations according to §86 and §86a of the German Penal Code (StGB) (Nazi symbols and others),</li>
					<li>items with symbols relating to groups associated with the “alt furry” movement,</li>
					<li>items with variations or modifications similar enough to be mistaken for a symbol mentioned above or intentionally obscured renderings of those symbols,</li>
					<li>any kind of drugs and medications,</li>
					<li>items depicting pedophilia or zoophilia,</li>
					<li>items depicting any kind of excessive violence, cruelty or rape.</li>

The responsibility to ensure proper permission for use of copyrighted material rests solely with the Dealer.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If an item or service requires a specific permit or a license for offering or selling the item or service, the Dealer is required to present the permit or license upon request at any time.</p>
		<p>Any item that violates this policy may be banned from display or sale on the sole discretion of the Dealers’ Den Management. Copyrighted items prohibited for sale include, but are not limited to, unlicensed depictions of any characters appearing in any media or counterfeit merchandise of any kind.</p>
		<p>Unlike Common Law countries, the German copyright law does not include a general Fair Use / Fair Dealing exception. Dealers are advised to inform themselves about compliance with European and German copyright law, applicable trademarks, as well as topics like parodies and fan art prior to their attendance. The Eurofurence Dealers’ Den Staff must not give any legal advice on this matter.</p>
		<p>
