    LOG ENTRY: WAITING FOR SOL 69
</p>
<div class="uk-column-1-2@l">
    <p>
        Honestly? I haven’t felt this alert in a long time.<br />
        Sixty-nine days until I can reestablish contact with Ground Control. <br />
        Sounds like a lot. But it doesn’t feel like waiting. More like: preparation time.<br />
        I’m not even sure what exactly happened. Suddenly, contact with the space base was cut off. <br />
        Only one final message came through on my comms system: 69 Days. Hamburg calls.<br />
        That should be enough time… but yeah, where do I even begin?
    </p>
    <p>
        The Astra Project. Finally heading out into deep space. Infinite distances. <br />
        The year is 2025, and the Astra rocket was supposed to complete its final test flight, <br />
        yes, with me on board, to explore new worlds, discover new life and new civilizations. <br />
        The mission was meant to reach parts of space no one had ever seen before.<br />
        But then: red lights everywhere. Sirens. Systems maxed out. The alarm was going off. <br />
        I have encountered an anomaly! The Astra was suffering a major energy failure. <br />
        I'm sure the whole rocket glowed brightly red.<br />
        I think I reacted the right way in that moment. Maybe not perfectly, but right.  <br />
        I followed the manual, step by step.<br />
        I mean, sure: I’m a system test astronaut, not a rocket engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
        My job is to apply sealing tape with precision and not to bypass a central control computer. <br />
        But I know the manual. I know this ship. And I improvised where I had to. So I acted. <br />
        Reversed the polarity of the neutron flow, step by step. Just like in training.<br />
        Since then, life support has been running. And the comms system.<br />
        The rest? Silence. And space. A lot of space.
    </p>
    <p>
        So yeah. Here I am. Waiting for Sol 69. On my own. Alone, but not helpless.<br />
        Me, inside of a rocket – an otter. Space outside. So much space. And stars and solar dust...<br />
        Back to the beginning. Hamburg. Ground Control.<br />
        I can still send short messages. The system is stable. I’ll tell them what I’ve seen out here: strange planets, colorful nebulas, shimmering rings made of space rock, dancing asteroid fields… and so much more.<br />
        Yes, I’ll document everything.<br />
        No matter how fantastic, surreal or scientific it sounds. It should, no, it has to, be seen on Earth. I hope they find artists, animators, and storytellers of all kinds who can bring it to life. The mysteries and the endless sense of wonder that comes with exploring space.<br />
        I can’t wait to see what they come up with. The results will reach me in early September.
